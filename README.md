## 🌟 What is Forge Theory?

**Forge Theory** is a collection of interactive simulations that demonstrate **emergence**—the profound phenomenon where complex, sophisticated patterns and behaviors arise from surprisingly simple underlying rules.

Each simulation is a living proof that:
- 🌳 **Complex forests** emerge from basic branching rules
- 🦊 **Balanced ecosystems** emerge from predator-prey interactions  
- 🧠 **Neural patterns** emerge from simple firing thresholds
- 🗣️ **Full languages** emerge from communication pressures
- 🧬 **Multicellular life** emerge from cell division rules
- 🦾 **Optimal body forms** emerge from environmental selection
- 🌌 **Galaxies** emerge from gravitational forces
- 💻 **Better code** emerges from mutation and selection

> **No external dependencies. No build process. Just open and explore.**

## 💭 Philosophy

```
Simple Rules → Local Interactions → Global Patterns

Emergence is not magic—it's the natural consequence of 
components following simple rules and interacting with 
their neighbors. No component understands the global pattern, 
yet the pattern emerges nonetheless.

This is how:
  • Termites build cathedrals
  • Neurons create consciousness
  • Markets find equilibrium
  • Life evolves complexity
  • Cities self-organize
  • Code writes itself

Forge Theory exists to make this profound truth 
tangible, explorable, and inspiring.
```
